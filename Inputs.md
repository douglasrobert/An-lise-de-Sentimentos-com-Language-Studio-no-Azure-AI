 Tired hotel with poor service
 The Royal Hotel, London, United Kingdom
 5/6/2018
 1 - This is an old hotel (has been around since 1950's) and the room furnishings are average - becoming a bit old now and require changing.
 2 - The internet didn't work and had to come to one of their office rooms to check in for my flight home. 
 3 - The website says it's close to the British Museum, but it's too far to walk.
